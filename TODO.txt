SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE THE DATA CLASS SO THAT THE TARGET VALUES ARE UNSCALED.
THE WAY IT'S HANDLED CURRENTLY IN THE DATACLASS IS A LITTLE SILLY WOULD PROBABLY 
NEED TO MAKE A ANOTHER COPY OF THE Y'S TO DO THIS AND THEN ADJUST THE Y'S BASED ON
HOW MANY DAYS ARE USED TO PREDICT THE NEXT DAY

SOME OTHER STUFF SHOULD PROBABLY BE CHANGED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO REMOVE/ADD FINANCIAL FEATURES 
AND TO ADD MORE DAYS/LESS DAYS TO PREDICT THE NEXT DAYS PRICE WILL PROBABLY TRY TO DO THAT IN THE 
COMING DAYS
