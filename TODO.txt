FOR GETTING MORE ACCURATE APPROPRIATLEY SCALED RESULTS TO SEE HOW WELL I'M ACTUALLY MAKING 
PREDICTIONS I REALLY NEED TO RESCALE EVERYTHING SO I CAN ASSESS MY ACTUAL PERFORMANCE 

THIS CAN PRETTY EASILY BE DONE SHOULD BE DONE IN THE MORNING OR WHEN I'M LESS TIRED/LAZY

THIS WOULD INVLOVE ME GETTING THE APPROPRIATE SCALER FOR EACH SET OF DATA AND INSTEAD OF CALLING
GET ALL FROM THE DATA LOADER CLASS I'LL JUST GET THE PRICE AND PERCENTAGE DATA AND THEN IN 
EACH OF THE TEST FUNCTIONS I'LL HAVE TO CREATE A HELPER FUNCTION THAT WILL TAKE THE SCALER 
WILL INVERSE SCALE THE PRREDICTIONS AND I'LL ALSO HAVE TO RETURN THE "ACTUAL VALUES"
WHICH SHOULD BE SAVED IN THE DATA LOADER CLASS MADE SURE TO SAVE THOSE VALUES WHEN SCALING
SO I COULD GET AN ACCURATE ASSESMENT MORE VISUALIZATION CAN ALSO BE DONE CAN BUCKET EACH 
PREDICTION BASED ON HOW WELL IT DID AND CAN ALSO BUCKET EACH ACTUAL VALUE BY THE PERCENTAGE/PRICE
CHANGE AND WE CAN SEE HOW WELL IT PERFORMED FOR LARGE CHANGED SMALL CHANGES AND LITTLE TO NO CHANGES
WITH POSSIBLY MORE GRADATIONS TO SEE HOW WELL IT PERFORMS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF MOVMENTS
